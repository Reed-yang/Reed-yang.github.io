~~score my essay about a toefl independent writing task about Do you agree or disagree with the following statementï¼Ÿ Grades (marks) encourage students to learn. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.~~ 

It is difficult to refute that **grades regulate students to grind on studying**, and such a fact leads impressionable individuals to form the view that **marks itself is play an encouraging role in promoting students to learn**. However, such a claim is fraught with logical and factual inconsistencies, and it warrants careful examination.

Regarding **learning efficiency, students' mental health, and educational purpose**, I firmly assert that **emphasizing grades has negative effects on students' learning.**

To begin with, **students' learning efficiency is declined by focusing on grades**, which is supported by **a typical case, when we are staring at the rule or procedure too much, we may lose sight of the purpose itself, which is called rule displacement, and this is what grades playing in the students' learning stage.** It is further reinforced by **today's education methods that tend to quantify everything in the education, including students' grades and professors' teaching abilities, which leads to a grades-centered circumstance thus people only paying attention to the disciplines in the evaluation guidelines.**

Additionally, **nowadays younger students' are easier to feel anxious and depressed**, which indicates that **the grade is great harm to students' mental health.** For instance, **as the gaokao / kaoyan ratio is getting higher than ever, research shows that the student feel unhappy or depressed during their learning experience and more students had thoughts of suicide.** **Horriblely,** as a result of **pursuing grades, take XJTU as an example, more than 17 students jump over from the lecture hall to suicide last year.**

Despite this, a counterargument asserts that **grades may help students to focus on learning instead of choosing to hang out and enjoy amusement.** Ironically, **stating grades is not helpful for students to learn, to memorize fast and forget at most, and in this educational circle people seem to forget the original purpose of education, instead of being locked in the classroom, hanging out and participating in social activity is more meaningful.**

In summary, I maintain that **grades centered altitude is negative for students to learn.** While some may oppose me, I am reminded of  John Steinbeck that states "We all see the world from our own window.". I am confident that after reading my article, skeptics will see the merit in my argument.
