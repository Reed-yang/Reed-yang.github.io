Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?

Scientists should be responsible for the negative effects of their discoveries.

本题在今年线上线下考试多次出现。

本文尝试了极简的框架，全文只有290字但涵盖了五段基本所有的要素

\----------------------------

We cannot dismiss the fact that scientific discoveries have caused disasters in human history, especially the escalation of the scale of warfare. Thus, some believe that scientists should be held responsible for the negative consequences of their findings. Nevertheless, such idea has to be examined carefully before a conclusion can be reached.

First of all, it is not the scientists or their discoveries, but the users who determine the purposes of the discoveries. In other words, by no means can scientists predict if their discoveries will be used for righteous or evil purposes, and not to mention being responsible for the negative effects. The invention of nuclear technology is an excellent case in point – nuclear energy is clean and powerful, while nuclear weapon is capable of annihilating our planet with top efficiency.

Second, the nature of scientific work is full of uncertainty, and scientists need a free and encouraging atmosphere for the maximum effectiveness of their research. To be more specific, scientists should not worry about if their work will lead to potential negative effects, or their curiosity and innovation will be hindered by the fear for penalty or a sense of shame. Furthermore, even if they discover a destructive use of technology, such finding can be documented and shared with others for prevention instead of application.

Some might claim that the world runs a huge risk if scientists do not shoulder the consequences of their discoveries. However, governmental and institutional regulations can be set to track the progress of scientific work in order to steer the direction of our scientific work, creating more welfare for mankind.

While one sees a zero and another sees a circle, I strongly believe that scientists should be able to conduct their research freely.
