polish this essay template by refine it's wording: 

It is hard to deny that (opposite point), and such a fact leads impressionable people to generate the opinion that (opposite opinion). However, such a statement suffers from both logical and factual fallacies, and it should be examined meticulously.

As far as (Point 1), (Point 2), and (Point3) are concerned, I strongly hold that (your opinion).

First and foremost, (Point 1), as (Fact 1). Meanwhile, (Fact2). Not to mention that (Fact3).

Nevertheless, a voice arises that (opposite detail in grand opening). Ironically, (facts against opposite detail). Therefore, (Point 3).

In a nutshell, I maintain that (Your Response Paraphrase). Admittedly, as my favorite quote from ( A famous person) goes, (Famous person says), and some people may oppose me. However, I believe they will compromise after being exposed to my article.

It is difficult to refute the (opposite point) as it can lead impressionable individuals to form the view that (opposite opinion). However, such a claim is fraught with logical and factual inconsistencies, and it warrants careful examination.

Regarding (Point 1), (Point 2), and (Point 3), I firmly assert that (your opinion).

To begin with, (Point 1) is supported by (Fact 1), and further reinforced by (Fact 2) and (Fact 3).

Additionally, (point 2 mid level) points to (point 2 high level). For instance, (character) exemplifies this concept through their (process), resulting in (result).

Despite this, a counterargument asserts that (opposite detail in grand opening). Ironically, (facts against opposite detail) reinforce (Point 3).

In summary, I maintain that (Your Response Paraphrase). While some may oppose me, I am reminded of (Famous person's quote) that states (Famous person says). I am confident that after reading my article, skeptics will see the merit in my argument.

It cannot be denied that (opposite point), and this can easily sway the opinions of impressionable individuals to adopt the stance of (opposite opinion). However, this statement is riddled with logical and factual flaws, and requires a thorough analysis.

As for (Point 1), (Point 2), and (Point 3), I staunchly advocate for (your opinion).

Let's start with (Point 1), which is supported by (Fact 1), and fortified by (Fact 2) and (Fact 3).

Moreover, (point 2 mid level) clearly illustrates (point 2 high level), as exemplified by (character) who flawlessly executed (process), leading to (result).

Despite this, there is a dissenting voice that argues for (opposite detail in grand opening). The irony, however, is that (facts against opposite detail) only lend further credence to (Point 3).

In summary, I firmly uphold (Your Response Paraphrase), and in the words of (A Famous person), (insert quote ). It is possible that some may still disagree, but I am confident that my article will sway their opinion in my direction.
